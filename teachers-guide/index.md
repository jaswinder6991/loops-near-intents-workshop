## Quick Reference

### Emergency Commands
```bash
# Fund student account
near tokens FUNDING_ACCOUNT transfer-near STUDENT_ACCOUNT '0.25 NEAR' network-config mainnet sign-with-keychain send

# Check student balance  
near account view-account-summary STUDENT_ACCOUNT network-config mainnet now

# Check wNEAR balance
near view intents.near mt_batch_balance_of '{"account_id": "STUDENT_ACCOUNT", "token_ids": ["nep141:wrap.near"]}' --networkId mainnet

# Check ETH balance
near view intents.near mt_batch_balance_of '{"account_id": "STUDENT_ACCOUNT", "token_ids": ["nep141:eth.bridge.near"]}' --networkId mainnet
```

### Critical Timing Reminders
- **Deposits:** 30-60 seconds
- **Swaps:** 2-5 minutes  
- **Withdrawals:** 5-15 minutes (script times out at 60 seconds - NORMAL!)
- **Total workshop:** 2.5-3 hours

### Red Flag Responses
ðŸš¨ **"Should I run the script again?"** â†’ "NO! Wait for completion or timeout first"
ðŸš¨ **"My script failed"** â†’ Check if it's normal timeout vs. actual error
ðŸš¨ **"Can I use testnet?"** â†’ "No, intents only work on mainnet"
