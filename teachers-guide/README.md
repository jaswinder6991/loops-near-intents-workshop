# Teachers Guide for NEAR Cross-Chain Swaps Workshop

## Overview

This teachers guide provides comprehensive support for instructors leading the NEAR Cross-Chain Swaps Workshop. The guides assume instructors have completed the workshop themselves and focus on practical classroom management, student support, and troubleshooting.

## Pre-Workshop Requirements

### Instructor Prerequisites
- [ ] Complete the entire workshop yourself (all 8 modules)
- [ ] Have a funded NEAR account for distributing student funds
- [ ] Understand cross-chain operation timing expectations
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with NEAR and Arbitrum blockchain explorers

### Preparation Time Required
- **Total prep time:** 2 hours minimum
- **Critical setup time:** 45 minutes before workshop (Module 3 prep)
- **Student funding:** Calculate (# students √ó 0.25 NEAR) + 20% buffer

## Guide Structure

Each module guide contains:

### üìã Pre-Module Checklist
Essential preparation steps and timing for each module

### üë• Step-by-Step Instructor Actions  
Specific actions to take during the module, including command coordination and timing

### ‚ùì Common Questions to Prepare For
Pre-answered responses to frequently asked student questions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Student Mistakes
Prevention strategies and quick corrections for typical errors

### üö® Red Flags
Issues requiring immediate instructor intervention

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria
Clear indicators that students are ready to progress

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Expectation Setting (Module 1)
**Most important:** Set realistic timing expectations upfront
- Cross-chain operations take 5-15 minutes
- Script timeouts at 60 seconds are NORMAL and EXPECTED
- Workshop uses mainnet with real money (small amounts)

### 2. Technical Coordination (Module 3)
**Most challenging:** Environment setup requires careful coordination
- Stagger installations to prevent WiFi overload
- Fund student accounts immediately as IDs are created
- Address registration issues before deposits

### 3. Timeout Management (Module 6)
**Most anxiety-inducing:** Cross-chain withdrawals timeout normally
- Prepare students for 60-second script timeouts
- Emphasize operations continue in background
- Prevent retry attempts that create duplicate transactions

## Module-Specific Priorities

| Module | Key Focus | Time Needed | Critical Actions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Expectation setting | 10 min | Set timing expectations, distribute materials |
| 2 | Concept understanding | 20 min | Explain multi-token representations clearly |
| 3 | Technical setup | 25 min | Coordinate installations, fund accounts |
| 4 | First real transaction | 15 min | Monitor deposits, verify balances |
| 5 | Swap operations | 20 min | Manage API load, verify ETH receipt |
| 6 | Cross-chain withdrawals | 30 min | Timeout management, anxiety prevention |
| 7 | Advanced concepts | 20 min | Demonstrate reverse flows, real-world apps |
| 8 | Wrap-up | 15 min | Collect feedback, provide next steps |

## Emergency Protocols

### WiFi/Network Issues
1. Switch to mobile hotspots
2. Use pre-built Docker environments
3. Pair students with working setups

### NEAR Network Issues
1. Check status.near.org
2. Switch RPC endpoints if needed
3. Consider rescheduling if major outage

### API Rate Limiting
1. Stagger command execution more aggressively
2. Use instructor account for batch operations
3. Contact 1Click API support if needed

## Student Management Strategies

### Group Size Optimization
- **Ideal:** 10-15 students
- **Maximum:** 20 students with assistant instructor
- **Minimum:** 5 students for group dynamics

### Skill Level Management
- Mix experience levels for peer learning
- Pair advanced students with beginners
- Have advanced challenges ready

### Communication Channels
- Primary: In-person instruction
- Secondary: Slack/Discord for account IDs and troubleshooting
- Backup: Shared document for status tracking

## Pre-Workshop Instructor Checklist

### 48 Hours Before
- [ ] Test complete workshop flow yourself
- [ ] Prepare funding account with sufficient NEAR
- [ ] Set up communication channels
- [ ] Confirm venue internet capacity

### 24 Hours Before  
- [ ] Verify 1Click API and NEAR network status
- [ ] Prepare backup materials (pre-built environments)
- [ ] Review emergency protocols
- [ ] Confirm student attendance

### Day of Workshop
- [ ] Test all commands in venue environment
- [ ] Verify funding account balance
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Prepare student tracking spreadsheet

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- [ ] 90%+ students complete all operations successfully
- [ ] No major network or API failures
- [ ] Average module timing within 10% of planned

### Learning Success  
- [ ] Students can explain intent-based architecture
- [ ] Students understand cross-chain operation timing
- [ ] Students have concrete next steps

### Experience Success
- [ ] Positive student feedback on workshop flow
- [ ] Students feel confident to explore independently
- [ ] Students engage with advanced concepts

## Post-Workshop Actions

### Immediate (Same Day)
- [ ] Send follow-up resources to students
- [ ] Note any issues for next iteration
- [ ] Share feedback survey

### Within One Week
- [ ] Compile student feedback
- [ ] Update guides based on student questions
- [ ] Plan any follow-up sessions
