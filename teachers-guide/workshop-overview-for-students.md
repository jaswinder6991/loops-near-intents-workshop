# NEAR Cross-Chain Swaps Workshop Overview
*Instructor presentation guide for students*

## What You'll Accomplish Today

By the end of this workshop, you will have:
- ‚úÖ **Moved real value across blockchains** - Start with NEAR, end with ETH on Arbitrum
- ‚úÖ **Used intent-based systems** - Experience the future of blockchain UX
- ‚úÖ **Executed $0.20 worth of real operations** - Mainnet experience with minimal risk
- ‚úÖ **Understood cross-chain architecture** - Without needing to become a bridge expert

**Why This Matters:** You'll experience true blockchain interoperability - the ability to use any asset on any chain seamlessly.

## Workshop Journey: 8 Modules, 2.5 Hours

### Module 1: Introduction (10 minutes)
**What happens:** Workshop logistics and expectations  
**Key insight:** Intent-based operations abstract away complexity

### Module 2: Understanding Cross-Chain Assets (20 minutes)
**What happens:** Learn how tokens exist across multiple blockchains  
**Why valuable:** Foundation for understanding all cross-chain operations  
**Key insight:** Same value, different representations - like money in different bank accounts

### Module 3: Environment Setup (25 minutes)
**What happens:** Install tools, create accounts, receive funding  
**Why valuable:** Get hands-on with NEAR tooling and mainnet operations  
**Key insight:** Real blockchain development is accessible and affordable

### Module 4: Cross-Chain Deposits (15 minutes)
**What happens:** Convert NEAR tokens for cross-chain use  
**Why valuable:** Your first real blockchain transaction - see money move on explorers  
**Key insight:** "Wrapping" prepares tokens for complex operations

### Module 5: Asset Swapping (20 minutes)  
**What happens:** Swap NEAR for ETH (both on NEAR blockchain)  
**Why valuable:** Experience intent-based swapping vs. traditional DEX complexity  
**Key insight:** Cross-chain swaps can happen entirely on one chain

### Module 6: Cross-Chain Withdrawals (30 minutes)
**What happens:** Move ETH from NEAR to Arbitrum blockchain  
**Why valuable:** True cross-chain operation - value moves between different blockchains  
**Key insight:** Cross-chain takes time (5-15 min) but enables global interoperability

### Module 7: Advanced Workflows (20 minutes)
**What happens:** See complex multi-step operations and real-world applications  
**Why valuable:** Understand the full potential beyond simple swaps  
**Key insight:** Intent-based systems enable applications previously too complex for users

### Module 8: Conclusion (15 minutes)
**What happens:** Recap achievements, next steps, resources  
**Why valuable:** Plan your continued learning and application development  
**Key insight:** You now understand the future of blockchain UX

## Critical Expectations to Set

### ‚è∞ Timing Reality
- **Cross-chain operations take time** - Not instant like single-chain
- **Scripts will timeout at 60 seconds** - This is NORMAL and EXPECTED
- **Operations continue in background** - Your transactions don't fail when scripts timeout
- **Total journey: NEAR ‚Üí ETH on Arbitrum takes ~20 minutes**

### üí∞ Real Money, Small Risk
- **Using mainnet** - Real blockchains, real value
- **~$0.20 total cost** - Safer than buying coffee
- **Learning focus** - Amounts don't matter, understanding does

### üîß Technical Approach
- **You use intents, not build them** - Consumer perspective, not developer
- **API handles complexity** - No need to understand bridge protocols
- **Commands provided** - Copy/paste with explanation

## Value Propositions by Audience

### **For Developers**
"See how intent-based systems can simplify your users' cross-chain experience"

### **For Business/Product People** 
"Understand new UX possibilities when blockchain complexity is abstracted away"

### **For Crypto Users**
"Experience the future of DeFi - use any asset on any chain seamlessly"

### **For Blockchain Curious**
"Hands-on with real blockchain operations without the usual complexity"

---

## Success Indicators

**You'll know the workshop succeeded when you can:**
1. **Explain to others** how intent-based operations work
2. **Show your Arbitrum wallet** with ETH you moved from NEAR
3. **Understand why** cross-chain operations take longer than single-chain
4. **Imagine applications** that use these capabilities
5. **Feel confident** exploring further on your own

## Key Mindset Shifts

### Before Workshop: 
*"Cross-chain is too complex, I need to understand bridges, manage gas on multiple chains, deal with different wallet interfaces..."*

### After Workshop:
*"I can declare what I want ('ETH on Arbitrum') and the system figures out how to make it happen."*

## Questions Before We Start?

Common pre-workshop questions:

**Q: "What if I lose the NEAR tokens?"**  
**A:** "It's $0.20 worth - less than a coffee. But we'll guide you through safely."

**Q: "Do I need blockchain experience?"**  
**A:** "Basic understanding helps, but intent-based systems are designed to be simpler than traditional blockchain interactions."

**Q: "Will this work on testnet?"**  
**A:** "No - intent infrastructure only exists on mainnet where real liquidity and solvers operate."

**Q: "What if operations fail?"**  
**A:** "Most 'failures' are actually normal timeouts. We'll teach you to distinguish real issues from expected behavior."
