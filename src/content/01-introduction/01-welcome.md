# 1.1: Welcome to NEAR Cross-Chain Swaps Workshop

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of blockchain concepts  
**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the power of cross-chain asset swaps using NEAR Intents
- Learn how the 1Click API simplifies complex cross-chain operations
- Get an overview of the workshop structure and what you'll build

## Introduction

Welcome to the NEAR Cross-Chain Swaps Workshop! In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to use NEAR Intents and the 1Click API to perform seamless cross-chain asset swaps.

**Web2 Parallel:** Think of cross-chain swaps like international money transfers. In traditional banking, moving money between different countries requires multiple intermediaries, conversion fees, and waiting periods. 

**Web3 Approach:** NEAR Intents and the 1Click API act like a universal financial translator that can instantly convert and move assets between different blockchains, similar to how a universal payment processor handles different currencies behind the scenes.

## What You'll Learn

In this workshop, you'll master:

1. **Cross-Chain Asset Management**: How to work with multi-token representations across different blockchains
2. **Intent-Based Swaps**: Using NEAR Intents to swap tokens without dealing with complex cross-chain infrastructure
3. **1Click API Integration**: Leveraging the 1Click API for seamless quote generation and execution
4. **Real-World Workflows**: Complete flows from NEAR to Arbitrum and back

## What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have implemented:

- **NEAR Token Deposits**: Converting native NEAR to cross-chain assets
- **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Swapping NEAR for ETH entirely on the NEAR blockchain
- **Cross-Chain Withdrawals**: Moving ETH from NEAR to Arbitrum
- **Reverse Flows**: Depositing ETH from Arbitrum back to NEAR

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is organized into focused modules:

1. **[Introduction](mdc:../01-introduction/01-welcome.md)** (Current) - Overview and setup
2. **[Understanding Cross-Chain Assets](mdc:../02-understanding-cross-chain-assets/01-multi-token-concepts.md)** - Core concepts and architecture
3. **[Environment Setup](mdc:../03-environment-setup/01-prerequisites.md)** - Development environment preparation
4. **[Cross-Chain Deposits](mdc:../04-cross-chain-deposits/01-near-deposits.md)** - Funding your cross-chain account
5. **[Asset Swapping](mdc:../05-asset-swapping/01-near-to-eth.md)** - Performing on-chain swaps
6. **[Cross-Chain Withdrawals](mdc:../06-cross-chain-withdrawals/01-eth-to-arbitrum.md)** - Moving assets between chains
7. **[Advanced Workflows](mdc:../07-advanced-workflows/01-reverse-flows.md)** - Complex multi-step operations

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts (tokens, transactions, wallets)
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Node.js development experience (helpful but not required)
- Access to testnet funds (we'll help you get these)

## Getting Started

Ready to dive into cross-chain swaps? Let's start by understanding the core concepts that make this all possible.
