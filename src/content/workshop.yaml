# Frequently Asked Questions
faqs:
  - question: "What makes NEAR Intents different from traditional bridges?"
    answer: "NEAR Intents abstract away bridge complexity, allowing you to express what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it. The 1Click API handles routing, fee optimization, and execution automatically, making cross-chain operations as simple as single-chain transactions."
  - question: "Do I need funds on multiple chains to complete this workshop?"
    answer: "You only need a small amount of NEAR tokens (0.1-0.2 NEAR) to get started. The workshop will guide you through obtaining testnet funds and will show you how to move assets between chains as part of the learning process."
  - question: "Can I use this in production applications?"
    answer: "Absolutely! The workshop teaches production-ready patterns with proper error handling, security considerations, and optimization techniques. Many developers use these exact patterns in live applications processing real value."
  - question: "How does this compare to building with traditional DEX aggregators?"
    answer: "Traditional DEX aggregators only work within single chains. NEAR Intents with 1Click API enables true cross-chain aggregation, finding the best prices and routes across multiple blockchains automatically, opening up entirely new DeFi possibilities."
